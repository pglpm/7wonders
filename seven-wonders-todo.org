* Add warning against Wikipedia

* Add discussion on terminology for "content", "flux", "source".

* Add discussion on more convenient interpretation of "force".

* Give constitutive relations for momentum and energy including transport terms

* Add note on symmetry of F⋅v and φ⋅v/c² expressions

* Add chapter or section on energy-mass moment or boost momentum

* Add discussion & example of decreasing momentum with increasing velocity

* Add discussion & example of forces like glue vs friction – broaden imagination

* Give more general definition of norm; correct this in velocity def.

* More rigorous discussion on derivation of dr/dt=v from boost momentum and requirement of no-matter-flux

* Add study of "slinky" or mass-bearing spring

* Change fiducial vector for energy

* Add more examples with chemical reactions

* Add discussion of intensive quantities

* Add references throughout

* Rewrite constit. eqn for energy flux of matter as valid for one side only

* Difference between theory and model

* Discuss analytic time-integration more

* Discuss notion (and uses) of "system" / "compartment".




* Other
** Add ref leveque kom flux
** Carter quote relativ easier than newt
** P, M as aux quantities
